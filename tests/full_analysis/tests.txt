rerun01 linked	    selection*		bic         all         success (this is a direct rerun)
rerun02	linked	    selection*		aic         all         success (just changed selection to aic)
rerun03	linked	    selection*		aicc        all         success (just changed selection to aicc)
rerun04	linked	    selection*		bic         greedy      success (changed search to greedy)
rerun05	linked	    selection*		bic         user        success (changed search to user)
rerun06	linked	    selection2**	bic         user        success (new set of models)
rerun07	linked	    selection3***	bic         user        success (added one extra model)
rerun08	linked	    selection4****	bic         user        success (removed three models)

rerun09 unlinked    selection       bic         all         failure (shouldn't be able to switch to unlinked after linked, the subsets will need to be deleted and re-analysed)
rerun10 unlinked    selection       aic         all         failure (shouldn't be able to switch to unlinked after linked, the subsets will need to be deleted and re-analysed)

rerun14	linked	    selection		bic         all         failure (I edited a sequence in the original alignment)
rerun15	linked	    selection		bic         all         failure (I edited a spp name in the original alignment)
rerun20	linked	    selection		bic         user        failure (I screwed up the user definitions to include a data_block that doesn't exist)
rerun21	linked	    selection		bic         user        failure (I screwed up the user definitions to exclude a data_block that does exist)

D N A 5 linked      selection       bic         user        success (A copy of DNA5 but with stupid spaces in the filename)



^
all reruns start with all the files from DNA3 in there. This lets us test
various things about loading in .cfg files with changes, added or subtracted
models, changed alignments etc.

*
Protein models for the selection
WAG, WAG+G, LG+I+G+F, JTT+F

DNA models for the selection
JC, JC+I, HKY, HKY+I+G, GTR, GTR+G

**
selection 2 has no models in common with selection
JC+G, HKY+I, GTR+I+G

***
selection 3 adds one model to the original selection
JC, JC+I, HKY, HKY+I+G, GTR, GTR+G, JC+I+G

****
selection 4 removes three models from the original selection
JC, HKY+I+G, GTR+G

Notes
-----

rerun9-13 are just various combinations to check that we always spot the
changed .cfg file if we switch to unlinked brlens
